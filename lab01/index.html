    <h2>How to Make Birria Tacos</h2>

    <p>Recipe by: [Adrianna Adarme]</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Remove the meat from the sauce and shred it with two forks.</li>
        <li>Add some of the sauce (the consomé) to a bowl and add a little beef broth if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
        <li>Mince up some onion and cilantro and mix it in a small bowl with a few squeezes of lime and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Add a spoonful of the cilantro and onion mixture to the consomé and add a squeeze of lime.</li>
        <li>Dip a corn tortilla into the top of the sauce. This should be mostly fat. And add it to a non-stick skillet, set over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Flip over and then add a small handful of shredded meat and a handful of Oaxacan cheese. Shape it into a quesadilla/taco. And flip it over so it can get crispy and melty on the other side.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a baking sheet and place in a 200F oven while you work your way through the rest of the Birria tacos.</li>
    </ol>
